                   Windows 8 was released in 2012 and was a major departure from the traditional Windows interface. 
                   It was designed to be more touch-friendly and was optimized for tablets and other touch devices. 
                   The Start menu was replaced with the Start screen, which featured live tiles that displayed real-time information.
                   The addition of the Microsoft Store allowed users to download apps and games directly to their devices using a trusted platform.
                   The OS also forced Secure Boot which the Linux community was not happy about, as it locked the PC from other OS's bring used.
                   While it wasn't majorly buggy or had any horrible issues, Desktop users were not happy with the changes, especially the lack of a Start menu.
                   Windows 8.1 was brought to address these issues in 2013, however it didn't help Microsoft as the majority of users stayed with Windows 7.
                   Windows Server 2012 was released alongside Windows 8 and was designed to be more cloud-friendly and included new features like Storage Spaces and Hyper-V 3.0.
                   Server 2012 was much more well received than its twin sister OS, Windows 8.
